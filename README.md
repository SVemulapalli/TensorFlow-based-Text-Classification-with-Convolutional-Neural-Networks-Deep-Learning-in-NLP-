# TensorFlow based Text Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks Deep Learning in NLP 

Text classification represents a general classification task such as sentiment analysis, email classification as spam or non-spam, document categorization etc. Deep learning and neural networks are getting better and better at text classification, with state-of-the-art technology such as Convolutional Neural Networks. Traditionally, CNNs have proven to be very effective for computer vision tasks such as tagging a person in the photo on social media websites, self-driving cars and many other tasks.
Recently, researchers have been found out growing interest in using CNNs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with areas such as Text Classification due to increased classification accuracy compared to other machine learning classifier models such as Na√Øve Bayes Classifier or SVM classifier. This project deals with the Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Text Classification with Sentiment Analysis task using Deep Learning framework TensorFlow. The dataset in this project is the Movie Review data from Rotten Tomatoes which was also used in the paper by Pang et al [1].
